He gets into the real business goals and routinely pulls out the simple straight forward solution that no one else saw. I have seen Roger unravel a mess that was handed to him and turn it into a gem that was the model for how to do things going forward. I tell people I want guys that are always leaning forward. Looking to do bigger, better, more. Roger is one of those guys.",
