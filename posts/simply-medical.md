## Purpose
The purpose of this post is to share a different technique of cross-training.  Specifically allocating cross training hours on nearest neighbors roles, and where it’s less generalized and more specific around the nearest neighbor roles.  This achieves a different approach to look at our work as a UI/UX Designer, expand our learning, and improve the final product delivered to our customer.

## What is this approach?

> Cross-training according to the Oxford Dictionary:  The action or practice of training or being trained in more than one role or skill.

This approach is a specific technique of cross-training emphasizing a deep learning of roles and skills nearest to you and less time spent on roles that are furthest from you in the organization.  In other words, co-workers to the left represent the work that you need to complete your work.  They deliver assets, and other resources to you.  Necessary assets for you to complete your work.  To the right represent those that will receive your assets, resources to complete their work.  The key point is to fully understand what it takes to complete their work.

## What it will achieve in the workplace
- A deeper understanding of what it takes for others to do their work.
- With a first-hand knowledge of difficult aspects of their work, you will request and set better expectations for assets you need, as well as those you send.
- Further along the UI/UX Designers role in the organization.
- Recognizing that our work is impacted by others, and our work impacts others.
- By casting a wider net beyond our direct responsibility we are drawn out of our specific roles, providing a wider source of understanding and awareness.
- More accurate time estimates for level of effort.
- At the organization level, employees will build stronger, more vibrant relationships with their nearest peers.  This leads to less turnover and improved employee satisfaction.

## How can this be accomplished?
- Many organizations do some version of cross-training during the hiring process.  Especially new hires coming straight from school.
  New employees are tasked to work in different disciplines throughout the organization.
  New hires could spend as much as 6 months traveling around the organization learning different roles.
  For example, a finance major who will be hired to work in the finance department gets the opportunity to work in sales,
  operations, inside sales, etc.  This approach is just an extension of that.  Once an employee knows exactly their role, determine who is before them in the chain of work and who follows.  Then immerse the new hire in those roles respectively.  The length of time doesn&apos;t matter as much as the amount of work.  In other words, the new hire would work in these positions until they had a full understanding of what a day in the life looks like in those roles.  The highs, the lows, and challenges faced.  This is the approach for new employees, what about existing employees?  Take this opportunity to cross-train in the specific roles before and after their own.

## How does this apply to a UI/UX designer directly?
- As a UI/UX designer the roles nearest me are:
- Graphic designer
- Asset providers such as videos, graphics, typography
- Front-end  developer
- Receives the work we produce to complete their work

## Understanding through examples
*  Scenario 1
*  Understanding how UI will be coded should directly impact your design
    *  2 options to design…
        *  The 1st option will increase dev time by 5% and improve the UI overall by a slight measure, let’s say 2%
            *  This version doesn&apos;t impact the overall look and feel
                *  Understanding the cause and effect of design decisions will improve speed to market.  This may not be something the FE designer is aware of.  He may not realize there is more than 1 option for design, and only consume what is given to him regardless if it takes 5% more time to code.  If the FE designer has a more than cursory understanding of UI design he may ask more questions instead of accepting the UI as provided.  In essence, through conversation and dialog a pretty result is produced.  It’s not practical that every design decision would have to be vetted to this degree, nor do I consider all of this dialog needs to documented formally.  Having a deeper knowledge and caring about what will be delivered will carry the day.
*  If I were developing this code, how would I do it, and are there better design decisions that could be made to speed up development time, and improve the overall look and feel of the application?
*  Discuss the points of how to discuss this with the business
*  You are a steward to how the assets are provided to you and how the design will be implemented.


## Why should I care?
- Solid understanding of how long it takes to get things done
    - Quickly recognize when things are getting done quickly or taking longer than expected.  Coming from a place of true knowledge and understanding
- Efficiency
- This will sound zen, but expressing curiosity in areas that have an impact on your work will impact your coworkers
    - Expresses the importance of their work
    - More that a cursory understanding of a day in the life, and challenges faced
